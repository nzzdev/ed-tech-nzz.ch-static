# What is this?
Trying to simulate darkmode or articles with a colored background

# Is it old or new?
It was added in Dec. 2025 when the rest of the static package was old but the NZZ website had been migrated in September 2025 already. We are currently in a hacky middleground. Please update soon.

# How do I use this?
Add the option darkMode=true or articleBg='#448855' when you call getHtml()
